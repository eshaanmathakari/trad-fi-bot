"Why is personal finance important Not getting control of your personal finances can leave you unprotected when a crisis comes alongwhether its an illness, an unexpected job loss, or the death of the family breadwinner.

The pandemic that began in March 2020 showed all of these issues in sharp relief and showed the importance of planning for emergencies."
"Should I be managing my finances differently since COVID19 What the pandemic showed is that people are a lot more secure if they have an emergency fund, have learned to budget and have created a financial planone with a Plan B and Plan C. Those who havent done these things, should get busy doing them. Itand the war in Ukraineare both wakeup calls that stock market crashes can happen abruptly in a crisis and that everyone needs a crisis investment plan.

"How much liability insurance do I need for my car For starters, you need to buy at least the minimum amount for your state. The two types of liability coverage for an auto accident are bodily injury liability for injury to other people and property damage liability for property damage. Bodily injury liability specifies both a perperson liability and a total liability per accident. For any damage outside of that you will need to pay personally, unless you have an umbrella insurance policy to make up the difference.

"Do you need a smartphone to handle your money today Its certainly looking that way. Even Warren Buffett had to switch to one in 2020. Banking is increasingly done online, budgeting apps are more convenient to use with a phone than a desktop or laptop, and its easier to check on your investments. And at work and elsewhere, twofactor authentication pretty much requires having a phone. So goes getting an Uber or Lyft. Learn More Is Having a Smartphone a Requirement"

"How do I wire money to someone If you need to move large amounts of money, a wire transfereither bank to bank or via an agent such as Western Unionis the safest way to go. Expect to pay a fee and review the fine print before you agree to the transfer. It may take a few hours or days, depending on the details.
